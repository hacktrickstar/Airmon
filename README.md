# Airmon

Code forked from https://github.com/HammillB/shinyei-ppd42ns

The Original Code no longer works as data.sparkfun.com has closed down. The idea of forking this project is to expand from it and add in particle cloud variables into the code to support the new firmware and system.

Renamed to Airmon.
